1. Use SONiC CLI to collect the following:
	 
Platform info
Software version
Running services
Interface summary

2. Basic BGP Configuration	
 
Configure BGP on a SONiC device with Local ASN, Peer IP & Network advertisement
Using vtysh or equivalent CLI, apply and verify config

**Assignment/Lab 3 [How to commit a code in SONiC] 23/7/2025

Fork and clone the SONiC repo; show git remote -v and active branch.
Create a new branch, make a small code/comment change, and commit using git commit -s.
Push the branch and create a draft Pull Request with a proper template.

**Assignment/Lab 4 [How to compile and run SAI Server Docker] 24/7/2025

Compile the SAI server Docker using make target/docker-saiserver.mk
Verify the Docker image is built successfully using docker images
Run the SAI server container and validate it with docker ps and log outputs
Document the build and run steps with key commands and observations.

**Assignment/Lab 5 [How to reset syncd Docker] 25/7/2025

Identify the hardware SKU and platform type using SONiC CLI.
Back up the current /etc/sonic/config_db.json for recovery.
Run reset-synced-docker command with appropriate -y flag to confirm action.
Verify that syncd container is stopped and restarted properly using docker ps -a.
Log and explain what changes occurred in /var/log/syslog or container logs during reset.

**Assignment/Lab 6 [How to write a PTF Test] 28/7/2025

Set up the PTF test environment and clone SONiC test repos.
Create a basic PTF test script using BaseTest class with setUp, runTest, and tearDown.
Send a custom Ethernet/IP packet using send_packet() and verify reception with verify_packet().
Run the test using ptf CLI and capture pass/fail logs.

**Assignment/Lab 7 [How to use SAI Player] 29/7/2025

Install or locate the sai_player tool within your SONiC build or container.
Obtain or generate a SAI log (recorded SAI API calls) for replay testing.
Run SAI Player using the SAI log file and observe behavior/output.
Log any API errors or differences in expected vs. replayed behavior.

**Assignment/Lab 8 [How to deploy SONiC] 30/7/2025

Download or build a SONiC image for your target platform.
Prepare the device by formatting and flashing the SONiC image using ONIE or PXE.
Boot into SONiC and validate services, interfaces, and platform info using CLI.
Configure basic system settings like hostname, interfaces, and default route.
Document the full deployment steps and initial verification results in a setup log.

**Assignment/Lab 9 [Using swssconfig to apply configuration] 31/7/2025

Create a valid JSON config file (e.g., for interfaces or VLANs) in the swssconfig format.
Use swssconfig to apply the JSON file into the Redis DB.
Verify the applied configuration using show commands or Redis CLI.
Check and document log output from the swss container post configuration.
